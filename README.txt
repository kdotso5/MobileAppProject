Instructions:

As a competent mobile application developer, your understanding of mobile application structure and design will help you to develop applications to meet customer requirements. The following project to develop a student scheduler/student progress tracking application, will help you to apply these skills in a familiar, real-world scenario. This task will allow you to demonstrate your ability to apply the skills learned in the course.



You will develop a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their terms, courses associated with each term, and assessment(s) associated with each course. The application will allow students to enter, edit, and delete term, course, and assessment data. It should provide summary and detailed views of courses for each term and provide alerts for upcoming performance and objective assessments. This application will use a SQLite database.



Input

Each of the following needs to be input into the application:

•  terms, including the following:

-      the term title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2)

-      the start date

-      the end date

•  courses, including the following:

-      the course title

-      the start date

-      the anticipated end date

-      the status (e.g., in progress, completed, dropped, plan to take)

-      the course mentor name(s), phone number(s), and email address(es)

-      objective and performance assessments associated with each course

•  the ability to add optional notes for each course

•  the ability to set alerts or notifications for the start and end date of each course

•  the ability to set alerts for goal dates for each objective and performance assessment



Output

Each of the following needs to be displayed by the application on a separate screen:

•  the navigation panel

•  a list of terms

•  a detailed view of each term, including the following:

-      the title (e.g., Term 1, Term 2)

-      the start date

-      the end date

•  a list of courses for each term

•  a detailed view of each course, including the following:

-      the course title

-      the start date

-      the anticipated end date

-      assessments

•  a list of performance and objective assessments for a selected course

•  a detailed view of each objective and performance assessment, including the following:

-      the due date for a selected course

-      notes for the selected course

-      sharing features (e.g., email, SMS)

REQUIREMENTS
Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of the submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide. 

 

You must use the rubric to direct the creation of your submission because it provides detailed criteria that will be used to evaluate your work. Each requirement below may be evaluated by more than one rubric aspect. The rubric aspect titles may contain hyperlinks to relevant portions of the course

 

Note: The assessment must be submitted in an Android Studio project using Java as the programming language. External plugins and libraries are not allowed in the project.

   

Note: Submit your performance assessment by including all Android project files, APK, and signed apk files in one zipped.zip file.



Note: The zip file submission must also keep the project file and folder structure intact for the Android Studio IDE.

b. add a minimum of one optional note per course

c. enter, edit, and delete course information

d. display optional notes

e. display a detailed view of the course, including the due date

f. set alerts for the start and end date, that will trigger when the application is not running

g. share notes via a sharing feature (either e-mail or SMS)

7. Include features that allow the user to do the following for each  assessment:

a. add performance and objective assessments for each  course, including the titles and due dates of the assessments

b. enter, edit, and delete assessment information

c. set alerts for goal dates, that will trigger when the application is not running



B. Design the following screen layouts, including appropriate GUI (graphical user interface) elements (e.g., navigation, input, and information) for each  layout:

•  home screen

•  list of terms

•  list of courses

•  list of assessments

•  detailed course view

•  detailed term view

•  detailed assessment view



C. Create a scheduler and progress tracking application as part of your mobile application from part A.



Note: This can be the implementation of part A.



1. Include the following implementation requirements in the application from part C. Be sure your application is a minimum version 4.0 mobile application:

•  an ArrayList

•  an intent
